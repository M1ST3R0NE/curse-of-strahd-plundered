Locale: [[Locations, People, Dictionary/Village Of Barovia/Village of Barovia\|Village of Barovia]]
Quest giver: [[Locations, People, Dictionary/NPC's/Ismark the Lesser\|Ismark the Lesser]]
Status: Completed

The [[Locations, People, Dictionary/Player Characters/Party\|party]] is tasked with assisting in the burial of the former [[Locations, People, Dictionary/Minor NPC's/Kolyan Indirovich\|Burgomaster]].  

*We meet Ismark the Lesser in the [[Locations, People, Dictionary/Village Of Barovia/Blood of the Vine Tavern\|Blood of the Vine Tavern]], he tells us he needs our help. In exchange, he will give us a reduced fee on the inn cost.  The task is simple: Escort his sister[^1] and his fathers body to the [[Locations, People, Dictionary/Village Of Barovia/Church in the Village\|Church in the Village]].  After a bit of exploring and a little resting, we go to the [[Locations, People, Dictionary/Village Of Barovia/Burgomasters Mansion\|Burgomasters Mansion]] to retrieve [[Locations, People, Dictionary/NPC's/Ireena Kolyana\|Ireena]].  However, we forgot to retrieve her brother first and so she is unwilling to cooperate, so we left her and got Ismark.  Ismark tells her the code Gingersnap, and she opens up to follow us.  It is revealed that her stalker, the reason we are needed for escort, is Strahd.  We procure a horse, and create a bit and bridle to carry the body.  Discussions were had about robbing the shopkeeper[^2] for a cart, but ultimately the party decided against it. We carry the body to the church, where we meet [[Locations, People, Dictionary/Minor NPC's/Father Donavich\|Father Donavich]].  The party decides to spend the night in the church, to wait until morning.  During the night, we witness ghostly figures marching towards [[Locations, People, Dictionary/Castle Ravenloft\|Castle Ravenloft]], disappearing into the building, then jumping from the top into the [[Locations, People, Dictionary/Barovian Mysteries/The Fog\|Fog]].  In the morning, the party helps to bury the burgomaster, completing the quest.  An ominous voice echo's from below the church as we are leaving however, begging the good father to feed it. We leave.*
