The Fog is everywhere in [[Locations, People, Dictionary/Barovia\|Barovia]], around the outskirts it appears to be as thick as a wall, and as solid as one as well.  Nothing seems to be able to penetrate/escape the fog wall, and so everyone that is in [[Locations, People, Dictionary/Barovia\|Barovia]], is also imprisoned there.
